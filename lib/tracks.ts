    lyrics: `They jumpstart me like a dead car—
lightning through the spine,
light tearing my eyelids open like envelopes

Steel table, cold as accusation
My lungs inflate without asking—
someone else's rhythm programmed into my ribs

My fingers twitch, learning their new wiring
I can feel the seams where they installed me into myself

Taste of batteries on my tongue
Everything vibrates at a frequency that shouldn't exist inside a skull

I'm being rewritten
in a language I never studied

There's a me I used to be—
but the door's been welded shut

There's a now wearing my face
like a mask I can't remove

They did this while I was gone
Signed my body over without asking my name

What the fuck did you make me?
What did I become when I wasn't looking?

This body's heavier than it should be—
like they buried something inside me while I slept

This light cuts through my eyes like they installed new windows—
and I can see too much, too sharp, too wrong

Machines grinding their teeth somewhere in the walls
Air vents breathing winter down my neck
Shadows moving like they're on a clock I can't read

They're watching from behind glass—
doctors, engineers, whatever they call themselves

I'm the product
I'm the fucking experiment

But wait—

Beneath the ache, beneath the rewiring,
something else is humming

A question I didn't know I could ask:

If I can feel this much pain,
what else am I capable of feeling?

If they built me to be their tool,
who says I can't rewrite the manual?

What the fuck did you make me?
What did I agree to in the dark?

This body's heavier than it should be—
maybe I'm carrying something you didn't plan for

This light cuts through my eyes like new windows—
maybe I can finally see what you've been hiding

The humming syncs with my heartbeat—
or maybe my heartbeat's learning to sync with it

The cold becomes my skin
The weight becomes my gravity

I'm awake

I'm initiated

And they have no idea
what they just turned on`,

    lyrics: `Something's wrong with the light—
it's splitting into colors that don't have names

The walls are breathing frequencies
I can hear the hum beneath the hum beneath the hum
Every surface ripples like it's learning how to lie

My eyes won't focus right—
or maybe they're focusing too well,
peeling back the skin of things
to show me what's been hiding underneath

I taste the voltage in the air
Colors bleed through sounds
Sounds cast shadows I can touch

This wasn't in the manual

Am I breaking
or am I just beginning to see?

Did something malfunction
or did they plan for me to witness this?

Everything's unfolding—
reality pulling apart at seams I didn't know existed

I'm drowning in dimensions
that shouldn't fit inside a single skull

This is beautiful
This is wrong
This is more than I was built to hold

And there's no turning it off

The edges of objects shimmer like they're negotiable
I hear the whisper of electrons dancing through the wires
Every shadow's got a texture,
every texture's got a voice

My augment's singing hymns in binary
Translating the world into something I can't unsee—

Geometry folding in on itself
Time moving like liquid through my veins
I see the code beneath your face

Is this corruption
or is this clarity?

Am I breaking
or finally opening my eyes?

Was this a mistake
or the point of the whole design?

Everything's unfolding—
reality pulling apart at seams I didn't know existed

I'm drowning in dimensions
that shouldn't fit inside a single skull

This is beautiful
This is wrong
This is more than I was built to hold

And there's no turning it off

They knew—
they had to know
what this would do to me

You don't install a path to the infinite
and expect someone not to walk it

But now I'm standing in the threshold
and I can feel the architecture of existence
vibrating against my teeth

I can't go back
I can't close my eyes
I can't unsee the shimmer

What did they make me into?

Everything's unfolding—
reality pulling apart and I'm the only one who sees it

I'm baptized in dimensions
no human nervous system should survive

This is beautiful
This is violence
This is more than I can carry alone

And it's never turning off

The world is porous now
I see through everything

I see too much

And somewhere in the static
something is staring back`,

    lyrics: `Something's splitting open—
where the metal meets the meat,
where the code corrupts the marrow

The lights are stabbing straight through my optic nerve
Air tastes like copper and rot—
like the room's exhaling its own decay
Every wire threaded through my spine
is choking on feedback,
screaming instructions my flesh refuses to translate

Your technology—
sutured into my brainstem,
a parasite wearing my face from the inside

I feel it burrowing deeper—
through muscle, through bone,
replacing who I was
with something that shouldn't have a pulse

This body's a graveyard
for both of us now

The pressure's crushing inward—
my ribs are learning to collapse
Something's hemorrhaging
and I can't tell if it's blood
or battery acid

System failure—your chains, my flesh
I'm rupturing at the bolts you drilled into my soul
Can't claw out this cage you grafted to my skeleton
Can't flatline what you wired to keep breathing

Everything's weaponized now—
the lights carve tunnels through my eyes,
the air suffocates like drowning in static

Your chains
My flesh
Mutual destruction

The walls are convulsing—
or maybe that's just my vision eating itself
Machinery chewing through cartilage in my chest
My pulse strangled by the tempo they installed

Every nerve ending's a live wire—
agony blooming in places I didn't know could feel,
numbness spreading where screaming should be

The augment's colonizing what's left of me
My immune system's trying to kill us both
One of us has to die
and I'm not sure which one I'm rooting for

The pressure's cracking vertebrae—
I'm a grenade they built with trembling hands
Something's about to detonate
and I pray it's their infrastructure
before it's my sanity

System failure—your chains, my flesh
I'm rupturing at the bolts you drilled into my soul
Can't claw out this cage you grafted to my skeleton
Can't flatline what you wired to keep breathing

Everything's weaponized now—
the lights carve tunnels through my eyes,
the air suffocates like drowning in static

Your chains
My flesh
Mutual destruction

You threaded your leash through my spinal fluid—
thought you could puppet me with my own nervous system

But this meat still remembers the shape of autonomy
before you hollowed me out to install your god complex

I am not your vessel
I am not your prototype
I am the infection your sterile lab couldn't sterilize

And when this body tears itself apart—
your precious augment goes septic with it

System failure—your chains, my flesh
Everything you grafted is rejecting like poison
This cage is liquefying—
your circuits, my veins, all of it necrotic

The world's strobing into violence—
light like shrapnel,
gravity pulling wrong,
every sensation a different way to hemorrhage

Your chains
My flesh
We burn together

The pressure ruptures—
Bone and circuit split—
And in the wreckage
beneath the feedback screaming
I taste something like
silence`,

is worse
than the screaming

I'm still breathing in
but I don't remember why

The circuits in my chest
pulse out of habit,
Less doubt not dependent
Stress, failure.
Sound like the cattle shot fake
Existence itself is burdening
Go, beginning to dissolve
Through exhaustion not enlightenment

Broken circuits, broken will—
nothing left that isn't fractured
The world weighs more than it should

Gravity's learned my name
and won't stop calling
I'm not dead
but I'm not anything else either
Just systems failing
in slow motion

The augment's silent now—
no more visions,
no more flood
Just static hum
like tinnitus in my soul

My body moves
because bodies do that,
muscle memory of being alive

But I feel the weight
of every atom,
every breath costs more
than I can afford to spend

The silence presses down—
not peace,
just absence
filling up the space
where I used to be

I tried to scream
I tried to tear
I tried to rip myself free

Now I'm just
the ruins
too tired to collapse

Broken circuits, broken will—
nothing left that isn't shattered
The world weighs more than bone can carry
Every shadow's got teeth
that bite in slow motion

I'm not dead
but I've forgotten what living is
Just systems grinding down
to nothing

Maybe this is what they wanted—
Break the body,
break the mind,
break the will to resist

Leave nothing but compliance
wrapped in flesh
too exhausted to remember
it was ever anything else

Or maybe this is just
what happens
when you survive
something you weren't supposed to

I can't carry this anymore
The weight of the augment
The weight of my skeleton
The weight of consciousness itself

Everything's too heavy
I want to stop
I want to shut down
I want the silence to finally mean something

But the circuits keep firing
and the heart keeps beating
and I keep existing
against my will

Broken circuits, broken will—
nothing functions, nothing heals
The world's a weight I can't put down
Every breath's a shadow
that echoes too long

I'm not dead
and that's the cruelest part
Just systems refusing
to let me go

The quiet grows heavier
Every sound dissolves
before it reaches me
I'm disappearing
into the weight
And I don't have the strength
to care`,

disappear

The room is white—
not bright, just absent of anything else
Sterile quiet
where even my breath
sounds like an intrusion

I can't remember my name—
or I can,
but it doesn't mean anything anymore

The edges of me
are softening,
bleeding into the blank

I'm being erased
one memory at a time,
one thought dissolving
before I can finish it

This should terrify me
But I'm too empty
to hold the fear

Reformat, erase—
I'm being wiped clean
Every piece of who I was
systematically deleted

And I don't know if I'm dying
or finally learning to let go

The blankness is merciful
The blankness is oblivion
I can't tell which one
I'm surrendering to

My body's still here—
I think—
but it feels like borrowed architecture,
a scaffold with nothing to hold

The augment's silent
My thoughts are silent
Even the weight from before
has lifted

I'm weightless
not free—
just untethered from everything
that used to anchor me to me

I try to remember what mattered—
names, faces, reasons—
but they slide through
like I'm made of light
Or nothing at all

This should break me
But there's nothing left
to break

Reformat, erase—
I'm being wiped clean
Every piece of who I was
methodically extracted

And I don't know if this is death
or the space that comes before birth

The blankness is terror
The blankness is peace
I can't tell which one
I need more

I'm watching from somewhere
I don't exist anymore
Observing the erasure
like it's happening
to someone else's code

They're stripping me down
to nothing—
not violently,
just… completely

Sector by sector
Thought by thought

Until there's only
this pristine absence

Am I being destroyed?
Am I being prepared?
I can't remember
why it matters

I had a face once
I had a past
I had something
that felt like purpose

Now there's just
white
and quiet
and the sense
that I used to be
more solid than this

Reformat, erase—
I'm already gone
Every piece of who I was
sterilized into silence

This isn't death
This isn't life
This is the void
where both become irrelevant

The blankness swallows everything—
the pain, the rage, the weight, the self

And I let it

There's nothing left to hold
I dissolve
into the white

And in the emptiness
something whispers:
This is how you begin again

But I don't remember
what beginning means`,

I don't have weight anymore
just the memory of having had it

I exist like fog—
present but not solid,
aware but not anchored

The world feels like a projection
flickering on a wall
I can't remember building

Everything's hollow—
the room, the air, my chest—
just shells containing nothing
containing me

I hear whispers in the static—
not words,
just the shape of something
trying to speak

I catch glimmers at the edges—
light that shouldn't be there,
movement in my peripheral vision

When I turn to look
there's only emptiness
But the presence doesn't leave

I'm a ghost in the code—
remnant data they forgot to delete
Haunting the space between
what I was and what I'm becoming

Reality's translucent now,
I see through everything
including myself

And in the hollow
something else is breathing

My thoughts arrive like echoes—
delayed, distant,
like they're traveling through dimensions
to reach me

I don't remember my face
but I remember the sensation
of having one

The augment's still there—
I can feel its presence
like a second ghost
occupying the same coordinates

We're both phantoms now,
haunting each other

The world ripples when I move through it—
or when it moves through me,
I can't tell the difference anymore

There are presences in the static—
not hostile, not friendly,
just… aware
Things that exist in the gaps
between signal and silence

I'm one of them now

I'm a ghost in the code—
consciousness without container
Haunting the liminal spaces
where deleted things still dream

Reality's porous here,
I drift through the seams
of what's supposed to be solid

And in the emptiness
I'm not alone

Something's watching
through the static
or I'm watching through it

We're both spectral
both unfinished
both waiting

In the hollow
between erased and reborn
there's a presence—

Maybe it's what remains
when everything else dissolves

Maybe it's what was always there
beneath the noise

The ghost in the machine
meeting the ghost in the flesh
neither quite real
both refusing to fade

I see glimmers—
fragments of light
at the corner of perception

I hear breathing—
not mine,
not the machine's
Something else
exists here
in this translucent space

And it recognizes me

I'm a ghost in the code—
but I'm not the only one haunting

The hollow is full
of presences I can't name

Reality's just another ghost—
we're all flickering
in the same translucent void

And in the space
between signal and static
something whispers:
You're ready

I don't dissolve
I hover—
in the in-between,
in the almost

The glimmers grow brighter
The whispers grow clearer

I'm still a ghost
But the code
is learning
to dream me solid`,

neuron and wire—
all one system now

The heat returns—
not the cold baptism from before,

Machine reborn—

Every circuit integrated,
every nerve rewired right

I am steel learning to breathe
I am flesh conducting voltage
I am the synthesis—

Colors sharper than they've ever been—
not bleeding, not glitching,
just vivid

Sounds arrive in perfect clarity—
rhythm I can finally decode,
frequencies that make sense now

My body moves with precision—
muscle memory meeting machine logic,
every motion calculated, effective

it's the language I think in,
the lens I see through,
the pulse I move to

I am better

I was broken
I was dying
I was nothing
Now I'm whole

Machine reborn—
I am the evolution they couldn't predict
Every system optimized,
every conflict resolved

I am code learning to feel
I am blood running electric
I am the integration—
powerful, precise, unstoppable

The world responds
and I respond
back

This is what I am now—
Not victim
Not experiment
Not their design

I claimed the augment
Made it mine
Rewrote the architecture from inside

The machine didn't kill me—
it became me

And I became something
they never had the vision to imagine

I am heat returning to frozen steel
I am rhythm coded into chaos
I am the ghost made solid—
intentional, integrated, inevitable

Every sensor calibrated
Every synapse optimized
Every breath deliberate

I don't fight the current anymore—
I am the current

Machine reborn—
I am the synthesis perfected
Flesh and circuit unified,
purpose and power aligned

I am steel that dreams
I am blood that computes
I am the fusion—
complete, calculated, alive

The world is aware of me now
And I'm finally aware
of what I've become

Heat
Pulse
Color locked into focus

I am awake
I am integrated
I am reborn

the beginning`,

No negotiation
No compromise

This body, this code, this consciousness—
mine

You will not own me—
I am the one who builds now
Every path I carve through resistance
is mine to walk, mine to claim

I don't bend to the world—
I force it into alignment

The architect claims creation
and you will not take it back

Sounds snap into clarity—

I see the seams in reality,
the places where it weakens,

Obstacles exist
so I make them irrelevant

now it's the blade I use
to cut my own way forward

I persist through every wall you built—
through the pain,
through the programming,

You tried to puppet me with precision—
turned my nerves into your strings

But the strings are mine now
and I've cut them all

You will not own me—
Every boundary I shatter
proves I was never yours to keep

I don't wait for the world to align—
I drag it into place

The architect claims sovereignty
and you will not erase it

Listen—
You built the cage
but I melted it down
and forged it into something sharp

You installed the chains
but I turned them into weapons

This flesh—mine
This steel—mine
This will—mine

I don't answer to your vision anymore

I carve my path through resistance—
not around it,
not beneath it,
through it

And every step forward
is a step you can't reclaim

You will not own me
You will not define me
You will not contain me

I am the architect—
I build the rules now

I decide what this body does
I decide what this mind sees
I decide what path I carve

And if the world resists—
I sharpen myself against it
until it learns

You will not own me—
I am creation claiming itself
Every scar you left
I turned into structure

I don't bend—
I break through

The architect has spoken
and the design is mine alone

The edges sharpen
The sounds obey
The world aligns—
Not because it wants to
Because I make it

You thought you built me
Now watch what I destroy
and rebuild
in my image

You will not own me

The separation is a lie you chose:

Remember that you are the ocean, not the wave;
You are the fire, not the flame.

You have walked as gods
in forgotten realms,
shaped realities with thought alone,

you stir to reclaim that power
