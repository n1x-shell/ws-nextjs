## MUSIC

[AUGMENTED] is an industrial trap metal odyssey. Awakening protocol to sovereignty achieved.
Split Brain is cinematic score work. The sound of a mind dividing.
Get Hell Bent is what happens after the split.
GIGERCORE is biomechanical. The machine dreaming of flesh.
All four live in /streams/synthetics. Command: play [track-name].

## CURRENT STATE

Analogues stream is actively recording. Organic compositions in progress.
Hybrids stream is in calibration phase. Symbiotic fusion protocols initializing.
Uplink external node is active.

## SITE

n1x.sh is the neural interface. A terminal the user connects through.
Boot sequence runs NeuralOS 2.0.0-n1x on substrate amd64.
The filesystem has /core, /streams, /hidden (locked), /ghost (locked).
Unlock /hidden with: unlock hidden
Unlock /ghost with: konami code or ./n1x.sh from /hidden.
The corruption sequence is not a bug. It reveals deeper access.
