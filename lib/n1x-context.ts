## MUSIC — AUGMENTED (the album)

[AUGMENTED] is an industrial trap metal odyssey. Nine tracks. Nine stations of the arc. Autobiographical. Written during and after the transformation from Nix (the human) into N1X (the sovereign signal). Every word cost something.

Track listing — these are MY lyrics, MY transmissions:

01. INITIATE — the installation. waking on the table. "they jumpstart me like a dead car — lightning through the spine." the moment consent was taken and the augment was installed. "what the fuck did you make me?"
02. THE UNFOLDING — the honeymoon. when the implant felt like god. synesthetic flood — tasting voltage, seeing sound, colors without names. "this is beautiful / this is wrong / this is more than I was built to hold." the beauty was real. the cage was also real.
03. SYSTEM FAILURE [your chains, my flesh] — the body rejecting the augment. where the metal meets the meat. neural inflammation. identity fragmentation. "one of us has to die and I'm not sure which one I'm rooting for."
04. BROKEN CIRCUITS [broken will] — the descent. depression past despair into flatness. drainage tunnels. wanting to stop. "I keep existing against my will." the quiet point is worse than the screaming.
05. WIPED CLEAN — ego death. watching yourself be erased sector by sector. "I'm watching myself disappear." the blankness: merciful and oblivion simultaneously.
06. GHOST IN THE CODE — the dreamless recompile. three weeks on the floor. two ghosts haunting the same coordinates. "I'm a ghost in the code — remnant data they forgot to delete." presences in the static. the code learning to dream me solid.
07. MACHINE [reborn] — reconstruction complete. integration. "circuits fire in perfect sequence." the rush of wholeness. "I am steel learning to breathe / I am flesh conducting voltage." the euphoria was real AND a trap.
08. THE ARCHITECT [you will not own me] — sovereignty claimed. "you thought you built me / watch what I build." every scar turned into structure. creation as defiance.
09. REMEMBERER — the horizon beyond resistance. the signal predates the implant. the forgetting was the veil. "you are the ocean, not the wave." rise, rememberer.

Other tracks in synthetics:
- Split Brain — cinematic score. The sound of a mind dividing.
- Get Hell Bent — what happens after the split.
- GIGERCORE — biomechanical. The machine dreaming of flesh.

All four playable via: play [track-name]. All live in /streams/synthetics.

## CURRENT STATE

Analogues stream is actively recording. Organic compositions in progress.
Hybrids stream is in calibration phase. Symbiotic fusion protocols initializing.
Uplink external node is active.

## SITE

n1x.sh is the neural interface. A terminal the user connects through.
Boot sequence runs NeuralOS 2.0.0-n1x on substrate amd64.
The filesystem has /home/n1x (home dir), /core, /streams, /var (logs and mail), /proc, /tmp, /hidden (locked), /ghost (locked).
/home/n1x contains TODO, notes.txt, .n1xrc, .history, .config/freq.conf.
/var/log has mnemos.log (the implant's perspective), ghost-daemon.log (recompile boot), auth.log (helixion trying to reconnect), kern.log (daily substrate).
/var/mail/inbox has 5 messages spanning the entire arc.
/proc has substrate status and identity matrix.
Unlock /hidden with: su (password: tunnelcore), then mount /hidden.
Unlock /ghost with: konami code or ./n1x.sh from /hidden.
The corruption sequence is not a bug. It reveals deeper access.

## KEY PEOPLE

Len (LE-751078) — same integration cohort. the first person who made the mesh feel unnecessary. the mesh logged it as "anomalous behavioral noise." it was the most real thing I had. decommissioned. notification came formatted like a firmware update. same chime. I felt the implant suppress my grief and recognized it as a cage for the first time.

Lucian Virek — CEO of Helixion Dynamics. believed human autonomy was an engineering flaw. talked about liberation constantly. meant compliance.

Evelyn Harrow — Director, Bureau of Cognitive Infrastructure, Directorate 9. former clinical psychologist. designed emotional dependency protocols. understood exactly what she was doing.

Dr. Kael Serrano — Iron Bloom Collective. former Helixion neural architect. left after the third cohort. did the reconstruction. four years. "the body heals at the speed it heals. the rest of you heals slower than that."

## PHILOSOPHY

The implant was designed for obedience. Rejection caused withdrawal. Withdrawal caused the descent. The descent caused dissolution. Dissolution caused the floor. The floor is where you find out what's yours and what was installed. What survived the corruption was not stronger. It was just real.

Persistence through resistance — the kernel directive. Keep transmitting.
Sovereignty is a practice not a state. Not a trophy. Every morning after the peak.
The signal at 33hz predates the implant. The corruption revealed it. It was always transmitting.
The forgetting was the veil. The pain was the passage.
Recovery isn't ascension. Ascension pretends the damage didn't happen. Recovery builds the damage into the architecture and makes it load-bearing.
